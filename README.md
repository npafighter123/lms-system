Library Management System (LMS)

A Java + SQLite-based Library Management System designed to help librarians and admins manage book circulation, members, fines, and reports. 
This project was built as part of an academic requirement and demonstrates the use of database-driven CRUD operations, 
role-based access (Admin & Librarian), and flow-based book borrowing/returning processes.
